# How This Website Works - A Beginner's Guide
# =============================================

Hey there! 👋 Welcome to the behind-the-scenes tour of the "Time Travel Elevator" website.
If you're new to coding, don't worry - I'll explain everything in plain English.


## WHAT IS THIS WEBSITE?
------------------------
This is a creative portfolio website that looks like an elevator traveling through
different time periods (1920s, 1960s, 1980s, 2000s, and the future). Each "floor"
has a unique visual style matching that era.


## THE THREE MAIN FILES
-----------------------
Every website is built with three types of files. Think of them like this:

1. index.html  = The SKELETON (structure and content)
2. style.css   = The CLOTHES (colors, fonts, animations)
3. script.js   = The BRAIN (interactive behavior)

Let's break each one down...


## FILE 1: index.html (The Skeleton)
------------------------------------
HTML stands for "HyperText Markup Language". It's not really a programming language -
it's more like a document structure.

Think of HTML like building with LEGO blocks. Each block is called a "tag" or "element":

    <div>  = A container/box (like a cardboard box to hold stuff)
    <h1>   = A big heading (like a chapter title)
    <p>    = A paragraph of text
    <button> = A clickable button
    <section> = A section of the page
    <a>    = A link to another page

Example from our site:
    <section id="floor-1" class="floor era-1920s">
        <h1>The Vault</h1>
        <p>Foundations & Security Architecture</p>
    </section>

This creates a section for Floor 1 with a title and description.

KEY CONCEPT - Classes and IDs:
- id="floor-1"     = A unique name (like your social security number)
- class="era-1920s" = A category (like saying "this is from the 1920s group")


## FILE 2: style.css (The Clothes)
----------------------------------
CSS stands for "Cascading Style Sheets". This is where we make things pretty!

CSS works like this:
    selector {
        property: value;
    }

Example:
    .era-1920s h1 {
        color: gold;
        font-size: 4rem;
    }

This says: "Find any h1 inside something with class 'era-1920s' and make it gold and big"

WHAT WE USE IN THIS SITE:

1. Colors
   - color: #D4AF37;  (text color - this is gold)
   - background: #000; (background color - this is black)
   - The # followed by letters/numbers is called a "hex code" - it's a color code

2. Fonts (Typography)
   - font-family: 'Playfair Display', serif;
   - We load fancy fonts from Google Fonts (free fonts from Google)

3. Animations
   - @keyframes = defines an animation
   - animation: spin 2s infinite; = applies the animation
   
   Example animation that makes something pulse:
   @keyframes groovyPulse {
       0% { transform: scale(1); }      /* Start: normal size */
       50% { transform: scale(1.05); }  /* Middle: slightly bigger */
       100% { transform: scale(1); }    /* End: back to normal */
   }

4. Flexbox & Grid
   - display: flex;  = Makes items line up nicely
   - display: grid;  = Creates a grid layout
   These are layout tools - they help position things on the page.

5. Special Effects
   - backdrop-filter: blur(10px); = Makes background blurry (glassmorphism effect)
   - box-shadow: 0 0 20px gold;   = Adds a glowing shadow
   - transform: scale(1.1);       = Makes something bigger
   - transition: all 0.3s ease;   = Makes changes happen smoothly over 0.3 seconds


## FILE 3: script.js (The Brain)
--------------------------------
JavaScript (JS) is the actual programming language. It makes things interactive!

OUR MAIN FEATURES:

1. Smooth Scrolling
   When you click a floor button, JS calculates where to scroll and animates it smoothly.

2. Intersection Observer
   This is a fancy way to detect when a floor becomes visible on screen.
   When you scroll to a new floor, it:
   - Updates the year display
   - Highlights the current floor button
   - Changes the background

3. Tutorial Popup
   - Shows when the page loads
   - Has a progress bar that fills up over 10 seconds
   - Auto-closes after 10 seconds
   - Can be skipped with the Skip button

HOW THE CODE IS ORGANIZED:

We use a "class" which is like a blueprint:

    class ElevatorPortfolio {
        constructor() {
            // This runs first - sets up variables
        }
        
        init() {
            // This starts everything
        }
        
        goToFloor(floorNumber) {
            // This handles going to a floor
        }
    }

Then we create an instance and start it:
    window.app = new ElevatorPortfolio();
    window.app.init();


## EXTERNAL RESOURCES USED
--------------------------
We don't use many external libraries - this site is mostly "vanilla" (plain HTML/CSS/JS).

1. Google Fonts (https://fonts.google.com)
   - Free fonts we import in the HTML head
   - Playfair Display (1920s elegant look)
   - Shrikhand (1960s groovy look)
   - Press Start 2P (1980s pixel/arcade look)
   - Orbitron (1980s tech look)
   - Comic Neue (2000s web look)
   - Montserrat (modern clean look)

   How to use:
   <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Playfair+Display&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">

2. That's it! No jQuery, no React, no frameworks.
   This is intentional - it keeps the site fast and teaches you the fundamentals.


## HOW THE "FLOORS" WORK
------------------------
Each era has three components:

1. A BACKGROUND LAYER (.bg-layer)
   - Sits behind everything
   - Has era-specific animations (tie-dye swirl, neon grid, etc.)
   - Only the active one is visible (opacity: 1)

2. A CONTENT SECTION (.floor)
   - Contains the actual text and content
   - Styled to match the era

3. A TRANSITION EFFECT (.transition-effect)
   - Plays briefly when switching floors
   - Different effect for each era (gate closing, VHS glitch, etc.)


## HOW ANIMATIONS WORK
----------------------
There are two types of animations:

1. CSS Transitions (simple)
   - For hover effects and simple changes
   - Example: transition: color 0.3s ease;
   - "When this thing changes, take 0.3 seconds to do it smoothly"

2. CSS Keyframe Animations (complex)
   - For repeating or multi-step animations
   - Example:
       @keyframes float {
           0% { transform: translateY(0); }
           50% { transform: translateY(-10px); }
           100% { transform: translateY(0); }
       }
   - Then apply it: animation: float 3s infinite;

## TIPS FOR BEGINNERS
---------------------
1. Right-click the page and select "Inspect" to open Developer Tools
   - You can see the HTML structure
   - You can modify CSS in real-time to experiment
   - The Console tab shows any JavaScript errors

2. Start small! Try changing:
   - A color value in style.css
   - Some text in index.html
   - The timing of an animation

3. Use MDN Web Docs (developer.mozilla.org) as your reference
   - Search for any CSS property or JavaScript method
   - It has great explanations and examples

4. Don't be afraid to break things!
   - That's why we have backups :)
   - You learn by experimenting
