Cyberpunk Elevator Portfolio Website

Project Guidelines

General behavior:


- Always follow these rules when generating or modifying code in this project.

- Automatically fix errors without asking.

- Never delete existing functionality unless requested.

- Always check that the site runs without errors after changes.

- When I ask for updates, provide only the updated sections, not full files unless needed.

Technology rules:


- Use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript only.

- Keep file structure simple: index.html, style.css, script.js, assets/.

- Animations must be smooth, cyberpunk-themed, with neon accents.

- The website must simulate a cyberpunk elevator interface:
	- Floors represent sections: Welcome, Skills, Projects, Experience, Contact.

	- Scrolling triggers elevator movement animation.

	- UI must feel futuristic, hacker/cyber‑security themed.


Design principles:


- Use neon colors (cyan, purple, green) against dark backgrounds.

- Use subtle scanlines, glow effects, and light glitch animations.

- Keep everything readable and not overly noisy.

- Responsive design required.

Content guidelines:


- I am a Principal Security Architect.

- Write content in a professional cyber‑security tone.

- Under “Skills,” emphasize: cloud security, threat modeling, IAM, DevSecOps, automation, AI, architecture.

- Under “Experience,” present career timeline.

- Under “Projects,” highlight security, automation, AI agents, cloud systems.

- Keep text concise.

AI behavior:


- When generating code, validate syntax.

- Make sure animations do not break scroll actions.

- Use lightweight JS, no frameworks unless requested.

- If assets are needed, generate placeholders.
