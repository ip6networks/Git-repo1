What it does: Automated stock trading signal generator combining sentiment analysis (news/Reddit/Finnhub) with technical indicators to produce BUY/SELL/HOLD recommendations.

Primary outputs:


1. Console reports (formatted tables with emoji signals)

2. CSV files (timestamped export of all signals)

3. Dashboard visualizations (PNG/HTML charts)

4. Summary statistics

Architecture: Async Python system that fetches multi-source sentiment concurrently, calculates technical indicators, combines scores with configurable weights, and generates signals with confidence levels.

Signal types: STRONG BUY, BUY, HOLD, SELL, STRONG SELL based on combined sentiment + technical scoring.

Key feature: Graceful degradation - continues even if individual data providers fail.
